### Design

1. Parallel EVM Transaction Processing
To architect a high-throughput system for processing EVM transactions without prior knowledge of their state access, the ideal model is optimistic execution. This strategy assumes transactions can run without conflict, executes them in parallel, and then verifies this assumption before committing the results. This approach is sometimes called Block-STM.

Data Structure for Parallel Execution
The key is to provide each parallel worker thread with an isolated, temporary view of the state while allowing fast, concurrent reads from the canonical state.

Shared State: The initial state (e.g., account balances, contract storage) is loaded into a concurrently readable data structure. A sharded concurrent hash map (like DashMap in Rust) is perfect, as it allows many threads to read from it at once with minimal blocking.

Local Transaction Buffers: Each worker thread processing a transaction does not write to the shared state directly. Instead, it maintains two local buffers:

Read Set: A HashSet<StorageKey> to log every state slot the transaction reads.

Write Set: A HashMap<StorageKey, StorageValue> to stage any state changes the transaction makes.

Dealing with Conflicting Storage Slots
Conflicts are identified and resolved after the initial parallel execution phase during a sequential validation phase.

Parallel Execution: The entire batch of transactions is run in parallel. Each successful execution produces a read set and a write set.

Sequential Validation: The system iterates through the transactions in their original, deterministic order. For each transaction Tx_N, it checks if its execution is still valid by comparing its read set against the combined write sets of all preceding, validated transactions (Tx_1...Tx_{N-1}).

Resolution:

No Conflict: The transaction is valid. Its write set is applied to the shared state, making its changes visible to subsequent validation steps.

Conflict: The transaction's result is stale and invalid. It is sent back to be re-executed against the newly updated state. This cycle repeats until the transaction can be validated successfully.

Execution and Storage Design
The architecture is a multi-stage pipeline designed to keep all CPU cores saturated with useful work while guaranteeing serializable consistency.

Optimization: Parallelizing the Validation Phase
A key observation is that a purely single-threaded validation loop can become a bottleneck, especially if the number of cores used for execution is high. While the validation logic is sequential, the process itself can be parallelized.

The advanced approach is to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of dependencies on the fly during validation.

The validator attempts to validate a large group of transactions in parallel.

When a conflict is detected (e.g., Tx_B reads a value written by Tx_A), Tx_B is not simply marked for re-execution later. Instead, it's marked as dependent on Tx_A.

The validator can continue processing other transactions, like Tx_C and Tx_D, that might have no dependencies and can be committed immediately.

Once Tx_A is committed, the system knows that Tx_B can be re-executed.

This creates a more dynamic and efficient multi-layered validation process. It allows the system to commit independent transactions in parallel and intelligently schedule the re-execution of only the transactions that were directly affected by a conflict. This significantly reduces the validation bottleneck and minimizes wasted work, especially in batches with mixed or high contention.
